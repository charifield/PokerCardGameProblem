Create a program that meets the following requirements:
1) Read a list of player names from an input file
2) Assign each player a set of 5 randomly selected cards from a card deck

1) Other aspects of the program can use libraries, or other sources, as long as those sources are attributed
1) You can use whatever technology you like to implement the game as long as we can see the source code and execute the final product.
