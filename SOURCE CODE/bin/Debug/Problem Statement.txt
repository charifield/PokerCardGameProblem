Create a program that meets the following requirements:
1) Read a list of player names from an input file
2) Assign each player a set of 5 randomly selected cards from a card deck
3) Display the players and their cards
4) Declare a winner

Notes:  
-The deck of cards will be a standard 52 card deck.  
-You can represent the cards in any way as long as the suit and rank are indicated
-The winner will be based on standard poker hand rankings https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands
-We will look at the structure you used to represent the deck.  Please do not use any libraries for this aspect of the program.
-Other aspects of the program can use libraries, or other sources, as long as those sources are attributed
-You can use whatever technology you like to implement the game as long as we can see the source code and execute the final product.
